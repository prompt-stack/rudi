Can I get a certificate for free AI courses?
Many online learning platforms with free AI courses offer an “audit” option that allows you to learn for free, but you must pay for a certificate. Some platforms provide full certification at no cost through scholarships.
How long does it take to learn AI?
For beginners, it takes 3–6 months to understand core AI concepts. Advanced skills may take 12+ months, depending on your learning pace.
Do I need a coding background to learn AI? No, you don’t if you are learning as an enthusiast, but you need to have programming experience to learn AI for a career or get a job as an AI engineer.
Which AI course is best for a non-technical person? Beginner AI courses, such as DeepLearning.ai’s Introduction to AI course, offer a basic understanding of AI without being overly technical. They also cover a range of AI concepts and applications, providing a well-rounded, basic education.
Can I get a job after taking an online AI course? Yes. If the course is certified, and you share your experience after taking the course with evidence of having learnt well online.
Are free AI courses enough to start a career? Maybe. Depends on which courses you take and what you build with the knowledge you gain from them. Taking these courses will allow you to test the waters to see if you are a good fit for an AI engineering career. They will also guide you in building AI projects, providing hands-on experience that you can add to your resume. However, some employers might require industry-recognised certifications.
