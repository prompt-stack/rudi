So now I see. So they have understanding artificial intelligence, understanding artificial intelligence. Let's see, let's see here. This is the whole thing. Understanding artificial intelligence. All right, this is their first course. Mm. Yeah, so that's the first one they do. And then the second one is then they do understanding chat GPT. And understanding chat GPT is, yeah, okay. Oh man, it was hella chapters. I messed that up. Oh, so there's the whole course. Yeah, understanding yeah, it's like this. Then the next one is understanding chat GPT. That makes sense, though, 'cause then you go from AI overview, and then you go into like the most popular tool just to get an idea. And then once you go into chat GPT, then it's understanding machine learning, which I think that this is if you're talking to a technical group, yeah, if you're talking to a technical group of people, then yes, this is the way you would go with understanding machine learning. But this then you would go, 'cause then the next one after that is large language models. Yeah, understanding large language models. [ Pause ] Language models. And after you get large language models, you get generative AI concepts. Exactly. Then this is probably getting into just the modalities, all the different modalities of generative AI. Because now. [ Pause ] Yeah, that's got a lot of videos. [ Pause ] And then you have AI ethics, perfect. Love videos, ethics. [ Pause ] Love it. This is perfect, this is. [ Pause ] And then you have lack of full course. [ Pause ] And you take a test. So that's kind of.
