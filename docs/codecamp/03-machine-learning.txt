What you'll learn
Define machine learning and recognize its relationship to artificial intelligence and data science.

Differentiate between supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning approaches and identify use cases for each.

Identify the steps of the machine learning workflow, including feature engineering, training, testing, and tuning.

Recognize model evaluation techniques such as confusion matrices and assess trade-offs between accuracy, precision, and recall.

Evaluate the benefits and limitations of machine learning, including issues of explainability, bias, and data quality.

Description
