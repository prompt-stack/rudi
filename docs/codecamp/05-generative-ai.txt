Description
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping our world like never before. Generative AI is a type of AI that can create new content from text, images, and more. In this no-coding course, you'll learn about the exciting concepts in this emerging field and how to prepare for a future where AI becomes widely adopted. You'll start by comprehending how these models create content, where they fit into the machine learning landscape, and how they are developed. Given the power of generative AI, you will also consider how laws and ethics play with these models, learning how to avoid bias and use generative AI responsibly. Finally, youâ€™ll look at the future of generative AI and how we can leverage and collaborate effectively with these tools. After this course, you, too, will be able to unlock the creative capabilities of generative AI. Let's go!
