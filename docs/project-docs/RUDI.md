RUDI = Responsible Use of Digital Intelligence.

TL;DR (7 words):
A studio + academy for responsible AI adoption.

⸻

1. One-liner

RUDI helps institutions (esp. schools) make smart, ethical, and effective use of generative AI through training, policy frameworks, and deployable tools.

2. 30-second pitch

RUDI is your AI literacy and governance partner. We translate fast-moving AI tech into practical decisions: policies, workflows, and hands-on skill building. We run cohort-based PD for educators, build decision-support playbooks, and prototype lightweight AI tools (PromptStack/RUDI Stack) that show “responsible use” in action.

3. Core Pieces (how it actually operates)
	•	Academy: Cohort PD, workshops, micro-credentials (e.g., Ohio TechCred-aligned).
	•	Policy & Governance Lab: Draft policies, data-governance templates, risk rubrics.
	•	Tooling/Methods: PromptStack, RUDI Stack, GrammarOps—codified workflows that make AI use auditable and teachable.
	•	Content Engine: Talks, guides, think pieces, Substack, TikTok/YT—public education and lead-gen.

4. Who it serves
	•	K–12 districts & ESCs, higher ed programs.
	•	Public agencies & nonprofits needing AI policy + literacy.
	•	Professional services teams wanting human-centered AI adoption.

5. Business model (working hypothesis)
	•	Paid PD cohorts & consulting retainers.
	•	Licensable curricula/toolkits (policy packs, prompt libraries, SOPs).
	•	Speaking + sponsored content.
	•	Potential SaaS/agent bundles spun out of PromptStack.

6. What makes it different
	•	Method-first, tool-agnostic: You teach how to think with/around AI, not just “here’s a tool.”
	•	Bridges policy ↔ practice: Governance docs tied to live workflows and code.
	•	Equity lens: Explicit focus on access, inclusion, and cultural context.
	•	You dogfood everything: Internal stacks double as demos.

7. What it’s NOT
	•	Not an “AI hype” keynote shop.
	•	Not a generic edtech reseller.
	•	Not only a policy whitepaper mill without implementation.

Gaps / Things to consider tightening
	•	Credentialing & outcomes: Will you issue CEUs/micro-credentials? How do orgs prove ROI?
	•	Repeatable product SKUs: Can a district click “Buy Package A” without bespoke scoping each time?
	•	Measurement framework: Pre/post literacy scores, policy maturity indices, adoption KPIs.
	•	IP protection & licensing: Clear terms for PromptStack/RUDI Stack usage.
	•	Pipeline clarity: How leads move from content → discovery → paid engagement.

Want this reframed as:
	•	a 10-slide deck outline?
	•	a 90-second script?
	•	a website hero + subheads?

Just say which audience/context.
