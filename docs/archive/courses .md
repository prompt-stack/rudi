## Fast Trends

**1. Short = Retention.**
<90s vids average \~28% retention (videos 8 & 9 at 30–31%). Anything >3 min drops to \~8–16%.

**2. Long = Saves & Follows.**
The “deep dives” (#6, #7, #12, #13) drive outsized saves and follower conversion despite weaker retention. They’re your lead magnets.

**3. “Cheat / Hack / Next X” framing wins.**

* “Hack Your Claude Usage Limit” (31% retention).
* “IDE: Your Next Office Power Tool” (23% retention, 9.65% full).
* “Why Your AI Code Breaks” (biggest reach + 1.55% follow rate).

**4. Tool-name SEO matters.**
Several vids pull 5–22% from Search (GenSpark, Claude code, Replit). You’re leaving free search traffic on the table on others—embed keywords on-screen & in captions/comments.

**5. 0–2s cliff everywhere.**
Even top performers dive immediately. Show payoff/visual first, speak second. Pattern break or “watch this do X” clip cold-open.

## What to Do Next (compressed)

1. **Two-track publishing:**

   * **Snackables (45–75s):** single insight or hack → boost retention & push to FYP.
   * **Deep Dives (2–4 min) in Parts:** Part 1 hook + promise, Part 2/3 detail. You’ll keep saves/follows without tanking retention.

2. **Hook templates to reuse:**

   * “Stop doing X. Do this instead in \[tool].”
   * “This turns \[familiar office task] into a 1-click workflow.”
   * “Here’s how I got around \[limitation] in \[tool].”
   * “Use \[dev concept] as your next \[office/business] power tool.”

3. **Systematize SEO:**

   * 3–5 exact-match keywords in caption, plus first pinned comment answering a query (“How to extend Claude prompts w/o paying more”).
   * On-screen text includes the exact phrase viewers search (“GenSpark workflow”, “Replit AI app”).

4. **CTAs that don’t kill retention:**

   * Mid-roll micro-CTA (“Save this to try later”).
   * End-frame 1-sec splash (“Part 2 pinned”).
   * Auto-reply to comments with mini follow-up vids (boosts watch loops).

5. **Measure next:**
   Track **Save %**, **Follow %**, **Search %** per video. Those three tell you which pieces to scale into products/newsletters/courses.

Want a Sheet/Notion with formulas + charts? Or pull in the other 140 vids to run regressions (length vs follow %, etc.)? Say the word.
