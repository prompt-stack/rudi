## Recommendations

### High Priority:
None - all critical functionality working

### Low Priority (UX Improvements):
1. **Intro Page:** Add `md:` prefix to centering classes to prevent vertical centering on mobile
   ```tsx
   // Change from:
   <div className="min-h-screen ... flex items-center justify-center ...">

   // To:
   <div className="min-h-screen ... flex md:items-center md:justify-center ...">
   ```

2. **Survey Page:** Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for power users (already has Enter key support for checkboxes)

3. **Results Page:** Consider adding print stylesheet for 8.5×11 mode

### Future Enhancements:
- Aggregate team dashboard (mentioned in intro page)
- Export results as PDF
- Email results option
- Comparison with industry benchmarks
