# RUDI Website Launch Strategy

## Recommended Approach: Progressive Enhancement

### Phase 1: Quick Launch (Week 1)
**Platform: Squarespace**
- Marketing site only
- Pages: Home, About, Services, Contact
- Blog for thought leadership
- Email capture for academy waitlist
- Professional templates, fast setup

**Why**: Get online presence immediately while building the real platform

### Phase 2: Custom Academy (Weeks 2-6)
**Platform: Next.js Custom Build**
- Build the academy platform separately
- Deploy to academy.rudi.ai subdomain
- Focus on:
  - User authentication
  - Course delivery system
  - Progress tracking
  - Certificate generation

### Phase 3: Tool Demos (Weeks 7-8)
**Platform: Next.js**
- Interactive PromptStack demo
- Policy builder tool
- Deploy to tools.rudi.ai

### Phase 4: Migration (Week 9-10)
**Consolidate Everything**
- Move marketing content from Squarespace to Next.js
- Unified platform at rudi.ai
- Keep Squarespace as backup/redirect

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Squarespace-Only Approach
**Pros:**
- $200-300/month all-in
- No development time
- Built-in CMS
- Reliable hosting

**Cons:**
- No custom functionality
- Limited academy features
- No interactive tools
- Can't showcase technical expertise
- Monthly fees forever

### Custom Build Approach
**Pros:**
- Full feature set possible
- Demonstrates AI/tech capabilities
- Own the platform
- Better for long-term growth
- Can monetize academy properly

**Cons:**
- 10 weeks development
- ~$50-100/month hosting
- Requires maintenance
- Higher initial investment

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Immediate online presence
- Build complex features properly
- Test market with simple site
- Lower risk

**Cons:**
- Some duplicate effort
- Two platforms initially

## Decision Framework

**Choose Squarespace-only if:**
- Need to launch in <1 week
- Academy isn't core to business model
- Don't need interactive demos
- Budget <$5k total

**Choose Custom if:**
- Academy is revenue driver
- Want to showcase technical expertise
- Need user accounts/progress tracking
- Have 2-3 months runway

**Choose Hybrid if:**
- Need web presence NOW
- But academy is crucial for business
- Want to test messaging before full build
- Can manage 2 platforms temporarily

## My Recommendation

Start with Squarespace TODAY for marketing, but immediately begin custom academy build. Here's why:

1. **Credibility**: You need a web presence to close deals NOW
2. **Complexity**: The academy features you want need custom code
3. **Demonstration**: Building PromptStack/RUDI Stack demos proves your expertise
4. **Revenue**: Proper academy = recurring revenue stream
5. **Growth**: Squarespace will limit you within 6 months

## Quick Start Plan

### This Week (Squarespace):
1. Choose template (recommend "Paloma" or "Laurel")
2. Write core pages
3. Set up blog
4. Add email capture
5. Launch by Friday

### Next Week (Custom):
1. Initialize Next.js project
2. Set up component library
3. Design database schema
4. Build auth system
5. Create first course module

This way you're not choosing between them - you're using each tool for what it's best at.
