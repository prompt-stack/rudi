# TechCred Opportunity Documents - Updated with Accurate Process

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Action:** Corrected TechCred process details based on official program guidelines

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT WAS CORRECTED**

### **1. Application Timeline**
**Was:** Listed 4 application windows for 2025-2026
**Now:** Shows confirmed November 3 - December 1, 2025 window only
- Notes that 2026 dates not yet announced
- Removed speculation about quarterly windows

### **2. Application Process**
**Was:** "RUDI provides all documentation"
**Now:** Accurate description of what RUDI actually provides:
- Training provider information for the application
- Application assistance (cost calculations, credential matching)
- Help navigating the TechCred portal
- **NOT** pre-filled applications or complete documentation packages

### **3. Reimbursement Documentation**
**Was:** Generic "we provide templates"
**Now:** Specific about what's required:
- Copy of credential/certificate (RUDI provides)
- Itemized invoice showing per-person cost (RUDI provides)
- Proof of payment (employer provides - cleared check/credit card/bank statement)
- Employee information (employer provides - name, SSN, wages, etc.)

### **4. RUDI's Role**
**Was:** Positioned as "handling everything"
**Now:** Accurately positioned as:
- Pre-approved training provider (52 credentials covered)
- Application assistance partner
- Documentation provider (invoices, certificates)
- Deadline reminder system
- Training delivery (flexible formats)

**Size:** 8.5x11 inch

**Corrections Made:**

   - Step 3: "Schedule RUDI training after approval. Complete within 12 months."
   - Step 4: "Submit docs within 6 weeks. RUDI provides invoices & certificate."
3. "What RUDI Provides" box ‚Üí 6 accurate bullet points
4. Warning box ‚Üí Clarifies RUDI provides documentation, not submission
