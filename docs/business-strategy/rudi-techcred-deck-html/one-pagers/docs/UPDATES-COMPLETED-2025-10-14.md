## üí° 2-PAGER CONSIDERATION

You mentioned being open to a 2-pager format. Here's when that might be valuable:

### **Keep 1-Pager When:**
- Quick introductions at conferences
- Leave-behinds after meetings
- Cold email attachments
- General awareness building

### **Create 2-Pager When:**
- Follow-up after initial interest
- Detailed proposal situations
- Client requested more information
- Want to include case studies/testimonials
- Need deeper dive into offerings

**Recommendation:** The V2 one-pagers are comprehensive but not crowded. A 2-pager would be great for:
- Page 1: What we currently have (overview, opportunity, offerings)
- Page 2: Deep dive (case studies, testimonials, detailed process, FAQs)

Let me know if you'd like me to create a 2-pager version!

| **Brand Positioning** | Generic program info | RUDI-centered |
| **Client Portfolio** | Not included | WCESC, OHSAI, Mercantile |
