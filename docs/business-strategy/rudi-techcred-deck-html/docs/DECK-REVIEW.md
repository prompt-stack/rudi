## üéØ **FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Before sharing with anyone:**
1. Fix all pricing to match Slide 11
2. Delete redundant Slide 13
3. Update Slide 02 statistics

### **For optimal effectiveness:**
4. Reorder: Pricing before Certificates
5. Standardize backgrounds
6. Verify all certificate durations

## üí° **ONE BIG INSIGHT**

Jennifer's meeting revealed: **The value isn't the training‚Äîit's removing barriers to the $180K.**

**Current deck structure:** Training ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Support
**Should be:** Support ‚Üí Value ‚Üí Training

**Consider this order:**
1. Cover
2. Executive Summary
3. **The Problem**: TechCred is complex (new slide?)
4. **The Solution**: We handle it (current Slide 04)
5. **The Value**: Pricing (current Slide 11)
6. **The Proof**: Research (current Slide 14)
7. Then: Framework, delivery, certificates

This puts the **pain point** first, then shows how RUDI solves it.

---

**Bottom Line:** The deck is 85% there. Fix pricing, remove redundancy, reorder for impact = world-class sales tool.
