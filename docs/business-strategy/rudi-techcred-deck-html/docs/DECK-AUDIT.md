## 🔍 **DUPLICATE CONTENT CHECK**

### **Intentional Duplicate:**
✅ **`slide-09b-pricing-packaging.html`** - Used TWICE
- **Slide 06:** First introduction to flexible pricing (in "The Opportunity" section)
- **Slide 15:** Reminder before call-to-action (in "Next Steps" section)
- **Reason:** Strategic repetition to reinforce pricing model at decision point

### **Content Overlap Analysis:**

| Content Topic | Primary Slide | Potential Overlap | Status |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| **TechCred Support** | Slide 07 (slide-03b) | slide-11-program-verification | ✅ No overlap (slide-11 deprecated) |
| **RUDI Identity** | Slide 02 (what-is-rudi) | slide-02-executive-summary | ✅ No overlap (executive-summary deprecated) |
| **Research/Credibility** | Slide 02 (what-is-rudi) | slide-12-research-evidence | ✅ No overlap (research-evidence deprecated) |
| **Framework Explanation** | Slide 12 (rudi-framework) | slide-05-competency-matrix | ✅ No overlap (competency-matrix deprecated) |
| **Training Formats** | Slide 13 (training-delivery-formats) | slide-06-technology-components | ✅ No overlap (technology-components deprecated) |

**Result:** ✅ NO UNINTENDED OVERLAPS

## 📊 **SLIDE ORDER VERIFICATION**

### **Section 1: WHO WE ARE (Slides 1-3)**
1. ✅ Cover - Establishes identity
2. ✅ What is RUDI? - Explains organization
3. ✅ Why RUDI is Different - Shows differentiators

**Flow Check:** ✅ Logical progression from identity → capabilities → differentiation

---

### **Section 2: THE OPPORTUNITY (Slides 4-7)**
4. ✅ Free AI Training - Simple TechCred intro
5. ✅ TechCred Eligible - 52 credentials
6. ✅ Flexible Pricing - Shows reimbursement potential
7. ✅ TechCred Support - "We handle the complexity"

**Flow Check:** ✅ Builds from concept → coverage → value → support

**Potential Issue:** ❓ Should pricing come BEFORE or AFTER support?
- **Current:** Support comes last (slide 7)
- **Alternative:** Could swap 6 & 7 (show support before pricing)
- **Recommendation:** KEEP CURRENT - showing value before complexity removal is stronger

---

### **Section 3: WHAT WE OFFER (Slides 8-11)**
8. ✅ Three Certifications - Visual roadmap
9. ✅ AI Literacy - Level 1 details
10. ✅ Applied GenAI - Level 2 details
11. ✅ AI Leadership - Level 3 details

**Flow Check:** ✅ Perfect progression with transition slide before details

---

### **Section 4: HOW IT WORKS (Slides 12-14)**
12. ✅ RUDI Framework - 3 dimensions
13. ✅ Training Delivery - Session formats
14. ✅ Customization - 4-step process

**Flow Check:** ✅ Methodology → logistics → tailoring

---

### **Section 5: NEXT STEPS (Slides 15-17)**
15. ✅ Flexible Pricing - Reminder (duplicate)
16. ✅ Timeline & Deadlines - Application windows
17. ✅ Contact - Get started

**Flow Check:** ✅ Value reminder → urgency → action

**Note on Duplicate:** The pricing slide repeat at slide 15 serves as a "reminder of value" before asking for commitment. This is intentional and effective.

---

## ⚠️ **ISSUES FOUND**

### **CRITICAL ISSUES:**
✅ NONE - All critical issues from previous review have been resolved

### **MINOR ISSUES:**

**Issue #2: Deprecated Files in Folder**
- **What:** 7 old HTML files still in folder
- **Impact:** LOW - Could cause confusion
