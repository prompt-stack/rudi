# RUDI TechCred Deck - Reorganization for Non-Technical Audiences

**Updated:** 2025-10-13
**Purpose:** Restructured for non-technical leaders unfamiliar with AI or TechCred
**Total Slides:** 17 (was 16)
**New Flow:** Story-driven, assumption-free, section-based

---

## üéØ **WHY THE REORGANIZATION?**

### **Problem with Original Deck:**
- Assumed knowledge of TechCred program
- Jumped into technical details too quickly
- Didn't establish RUDI's identity first
- Pricing came after certificate details (backwards)
- No clear narrative sections

### **Solution:**
Rebuilt the deck as a **story** with clear sections that build on each other:
1. **Who We Are** - Establish credibility
2. **The Opportunity** - Show the value (TechCred)
3. **What We Offer** - Present the certifications
4. **How It Works** - Explain delivery
5. **Next Steps** - Timeline & contact

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

### **Test the Flow:**

3. Ask: "Did you understand the TechCred opportunity?"
4. Ask: "What would you do next?"

### **Refinements Needed:**
1. Verify all certificate slides have consistent format
2. Consider adding "Success Stories" slide (after first pilot)
3. May need industry-specific versions (education vs manufacturing)

### **Marketing Assets to Create:**
1. **1-pager:** Slide 02 (What is RUDI?) as PDF
2. **Checklist:** Application requirements (from TechCred Support slide)
3. **Calendar:** Application windows (from Timeline slide)

## üí° **THE BIG IDEA**

**Old deck said:** "Here's what we teach, and by the way, TechCred will pay for it."

**New deck says:** "You can get free AI training worth $180K. We're the experts who make it happen. Here's how."

That's a **buyer-focused story**, not a **seller-focused pitch**.

---

**Bottom Line:** The deck is now structured for a **non-technical leader walking into their first AI conversation**. It assumes nothing, builds logically, and ends with a clear next step.
