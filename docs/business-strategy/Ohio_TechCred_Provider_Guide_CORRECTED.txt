OHIO TECHCRED - TRAINING PROVIDER GUIDE (CORRECTED VERSION)
============================================================
Last Updated: January 2025

⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTIONS FROM PREVIOUS VERSION
----------------------------------------------
This guide corrects important misconceptions about becoming a TechCred training provider.
While there's no formal "provider license," ALL credentials must still be approved by ODHE.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - THE REAL PICTURE
=====================================

THE TRUTH ABOUT TECHCRED PROVIDERS:
• NO formal provider registration required ✅
• BUT credentials MUST be approved by ODHE through TECHREC panel ⚠️
• NOT a free-for-all - legitimacy and recognition required ⚠️
• Two paths: Employer-driven OR Provider-driven submission

KEY REALITY: You can't just declare your training "TechCred-eligible" - it must go through official approval.


HOW THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS
==============================

1. THE APPROVAL REQUIREMENT
----------------------------
EVERY credential must be:
• Reviewed by the Technology Review of Educational Credentials (TECHREC) panel
• Approved by the Chancellor of Ohio Department of Higher Education (ODHE)
• Added to the official eligible credential list

You CANNOT:
• Self-declare TechCred eligibility
• Bypass the approval process
• Offer unapproved credentials for TechCred reimbursement

2. PROVIDER LEGITIMACY REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------
While there's no "provider license," ODHE expects credentials from:
• Recognized educational institutions (colleges, universities)
• Technical and career centers
• Authorized career schools
• Well-documented industry organizations
• Established certification bodies

NEW/UNRECOGNIZED PROVIDERS:
• Face higher scrutiny
• Should consider partnering with ODHE-recognized institutions
• Need strong documentation of industry recognition
• Benefit greatly from employer support letters

3. THE TWO REAL ENTRY PATHS
----------------------------

PATH 1: EMPLOYER-DRIVEN (EASIER)
---------------------------------
How it works:
1. Ohio employer identifies need for your credential
2. Employer includes it in their TechCred application
3. Employer provides justification and description
4. ODHE reviews through TECHREC panel
5. If approved, credential becomes eligible

Why this works better:
• Demonstrates real workforce demand
• Employer advocacy carries weight
• Less burden on new providers
• Faster path to approval

Requirements:
• Strong employer partnership
• Clear credential documentation
• Meets all three criteria (tech-focused, industry-recognized, short-term)

PATH 2: PROVIDER-DRIVEN (HARDER)
---------------------------------
How it works:
1. Provider submits credential directly to ODHE
2. Must provide comprehensive documentation
3. TECHREC panel reviews submission
4. Chancellor makes final decision
5. If approved, added to eligible list

Documentation required:
• Detailed syllabus
• Learning outcomes
• Assessment methods
• Proof of industry recognition
• Technology focus justification
• Duration verification
• Cost structure
• Success metrics (if available)

Why this is harder:
• Higher documentation burden
• Need established credibility
• Must prove industry recognition independently
• Longer approval timeline


REALITY CHECK FOR NEW PROVIDERS LIKE RUDI
==========================================

CHALLENGES:
• No established track record
• Not a recognized institution
• New framework/methodology
• Limited industry data

SOLUTIONS:
1. **Partner with recognized institution**
   - Community college
   - University continuing education
   - Career center
   - This provides instant credibility

2. **Employer-first strategy**
   - Get 3-5 Ohio employers interested
   - Have them request your credentials
   - Provide them with documentation
   - Let employer demand drive approval

3. **Build legitimacy package**
   - Industry expert endorsements
   - Advisory board with recognized names
   - Pilot program results
   - Letters of support
   - Media coverage

4. **Co-branding approach**
   - Partner issues certificate
   - You provide curriculum
   - Share revenue
   - Leverage their ODHE recognition


WHAT THE GUIDE GOT RIGHT VS. WRONG
===================================

✅ CORRECT:
• No formal provider registration/license
• Employers can request any credential
• Focus is on credential, not provider
• Open to various training organizations

⚠️ MISLEADING/INCOMPLETE:
• Made it sound too easy - approval still required
• Downplayed ODHE review process
• Didn't emphasize legitimacy requirements
• Oversimplified entry barriers for new providers

❌ WRONG:
• Implied you can just start offering TechCred training
• Suggested approval is automatic if criteria met
• Didn't clarify TECHREC panel gatekeeping role


CORRECTED PROCESS FOR RUDI
===========================

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:

1. ESTABLISH LEGITIMACY
   - Form LLC or formal business entity
   - Create professional materials
   - Build advisory board
   - Document framework thoroughly

2. FIND INSTITUTIONAL PARTNER
   Priority targets:
   - Columbus State Community College
   - Sinclair Community College
   - Ohio State University (continuing ed)
   - Local career centers

3. SECURE EMPLOYER CHAMPIONS
   - Get 3-5 Ohio employers committed
   - Document their AI training needs
   - Obtain letters of support
   - Have them ready to apply

4. PREPARE SUBMISSION PACKAGE
   - Complete curriculum documentation
   - Assessment methods
   - Industry alignment proof
   - Duration and cost details
   - Learning outcomes

5. DUAL-TRACK SUBMISSION
   - Have employers request in their applications
   - Simultaneously submit through partner institution
   - Maximize approval chances


LEGITIMATE PROVIDER INDICATORS
===============================

ODHE looks for:
• Established presence (physical or strong online)
• Qualified instructors/subject matter experts
• Quality assurance processes
• Student support systems
• Completion tracking
• Certificate issuance capability
• Assessment integrity
• Business registration/insurance
• Track record (or strong partner)


THE BOTTOM LINE
===============

CAN you offer TechCred training without being a recognized provider?
• Technically YES - if partnered or employer-sponsored
• Practically NO - not independently as unknown entity

SHOULD you try to go solo as new provider?
• Not recommended
• Partner with established institution
• Let employers drive demand
• Build credibility over time

FASTEST PATH for RUDI:
1. Partner with Ohio community college
2. Get 3 employers to commit
3. Submit through both channels
4. Leverage AI/GenAI priority status
5. Emphasize workforce need

Success requires:
