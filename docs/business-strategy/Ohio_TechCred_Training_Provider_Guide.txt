1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
---------------------
The Ohio TechCred program operates with an OPEN PROVIDER MODEL, meaning training providers do NOT need special registration or certification to participate. Instead, the focus is on offering APPROVED CREDENTIALS that meet specific criteria. This guide explains how training organizations can participate in the TechCred program and get their credentials approved.

KEY TAKEAWAY: Any training provider can participate in TechCred as long as they offer credentials that meet the program's requirements or successfully get their credentials added to the approved list.
