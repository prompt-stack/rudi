- Continuous learning journey
- Interconnected knowledge
- Progressive skill development
- Flexible pathways

### For Abstract Geometric Visualizations:
**Best fit:** framework.html

## Image Naming Convention Recommendations

Current naming is inconsistent. Suggest standardizing to:
- `hero-[page]-[description].png` (for main hero images)
- `section-[page]-[description].png` (for section images)
- `icon-[description].png` (for smaller graphics)
- `logo-[brand].png` (for logos)

Examples:
- `hero-courses-learning-flow.png`
- `section-framework-competency-model.png`
- `logo-upskill-ohio.png`

---

## Technical Considerations

### Image Optimization:
- Current images range from 39KB to 1.4MB
- Recommend optimizing all images >500KB
- Use WebP format for better compression
- Implement lazy loading for below-fold images

### Accessibility:
- All images need descriptive alt text
- Decorative images should have empty alt=""
- Complex diagrams need detailed descriptions

### Responsive Design:
- Provide 2x versions for retina displays
- Use srcset for responsive images
- Consider different crops for mobile vs desktop

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Place abstract-circular-flow.png on courses.html
2. **This Week:** Add geometric visualizations to framework.html
3. **Soon:** Source or create images for assessment and resources pages
4. **Future:** Professional photography for Ohio-specific content
