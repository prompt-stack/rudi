# RUDI Tech Stack Decision Rationale

## Framework: Next.js 14 vs Others

### Why Next.js 14:
- **Full-stack in one**: API routes + frontend eliminates need for separate backend
- **SEO critical**: Server-side rendering for marketing pages (Google rankings matter)
- **App Router**: Better performance with React Server Components
- **Image optimization**: Built-in next/image for fast loading
- **Incremental Static Regeneration**: Blog posts update without full rebuild

### Why NOT:
- **Remix**: Great but smaller ecosystem, less MDX tooling
- **Gatsby**: Static-only, can't handle dynamic academy features
- **Create React App**: No SSR, poor SEO, need separate backend
- **Vue/Nuxt**: Smaller talent pool, less enterprise adoption

## Styling: Tailwind CSS vs Others

### Why Tailwind:
- **Consistency**: Enforces design system through utility classes
- **Performance**: Only ships CSS you actually use
- **Developer velocity**: No context switching to CSS files
- **Component-friendly**: Works perfectly with component architecture
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first utilities built in

### Why NOT:
- **CSS Modules**: More boilerplate, harder to maintain consistency
- **Styled-components**: Runtime overhead, larger bundle
- **Emotion**: Similar issues to styled-components
- **Vanilla CSS**: No design system enforcement, harder to maintain

## Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma vs Others

### Why PostgreSQL:
- **Relational needs**: Courses → Modules → Lessons hierarchy
- **ACID compliance**: Financial transactions for course purchases
- **JSON support**: Flexible content storage when needed
- **Battle-tested**: Most reliable open-source database
- **Row-level security**: Important for multi-tenant academy

### Why Prisma:
- **Type safety**: Auto-generated TypeScript types
- **Migrations**: Version-controlled schema changes
- **Developer experience**: Intuitive query syntax
- **Performance**: Efficient query generation

### Why NOT:
- **MongoDB**: Document model doesn't fit relational academy data
- **Firebase**: Vendor lock-in, expensive at scale
- **Supabase**: Great but adds complexity vs Prisma
- **Raw SQL**: No type safety, more boilerplate

## Auth: NextAuth.js vs Others

### Why NextAuth:
- **Next.js native**: Designed specifically for Next.js
- **Provider flexibility**: Easy Google/GitHub/Email auth
- **Session management**: Handles JWT/cookies automatically
- **Database agnostic**: Works with our Prisma setup

### Why NOT:
- **Auth0**: Expensive at scale, another service to manage
- **Clerk**: Good but newer, less community
- **Supabase Auth**: Would require using all of Supabase
- **Custom**: Security risk, massive time investment

## Content: MDX vs Others

### Why MDX:
- **React components in markdown**: Interactive demos in docs
- **Type safety**: TypeScript support
- **Frontmatter**: Metadata for SEO and organization
- **Code highlighting**: Built-in syntax highlighting
- **Version control**: Content in Git, not CMS

### Why NOT:
- **Headless CMS**: Another service, less developer control
- **Contentful/Sanity**: Expensive, overkill for needs
- **Plain Markdown**: Can't embed interactive components
- **Database**: Harder to edit, no version control

## State Management: Zustand vs Others

### Why Zustand:
- **Lightweight**: 8KB vs 45KB for Redux Toolkit
- **Simple API**: Less boilerplate than Redux
- **TypeScript first**: Excellent TS support
- **React patterns**: Uses hooks natively

### Why NOT:
- **Redux**: Overkill for our needs, too much boilerplate
- **Context API**: Performance issues at scale
- **MobX**: Different mental model, steeper learning curve
- **Jotai/Recoil**: Too new, smaller community

## Deployment: Vercel vs Others

### Why Vercel:
- **Next.js creators**: Optimized for Next.js
- **Edge functions**: Global performance
- **Preview deployments**: Every PR gets a preview
- **Analytics**: Built-in Web Vitals monitoring
- **DX**: Git push = deploy

### Why NOT:
- **AWS**: Complex setup, overkill for needs
- **Netlify**: Good but less Next.js optimization
- **Railway/Render**: Less mature, fewer features
- **Self-hosted**: Maintenance overhead

## Testing: Jest + React Testing Library vs Others

### Why Jest + RTL:
- **Industry standard**: Most documentation/examples
- **Next.js support**: Works out of box
- **Component testing**: Tests user behavior, not implementation
- **Fast**: Parallel test execution

### Why NOT:
- **Vitest**: Newer, less Next.js integration
- **Cypress component**: Slower, meant for E2E
- **Enzyme**: Outdated, tests implementation details

## Architecture Decisions

### Monorepo vs Separate Repos
**Choice: Monorepo**
- Shared types between frontend/backend
- Atomic commits across stack
- Easier local development
- Single deployment pipeline

### REST vs GraphQL
**Choice: REST**
- Simpler for team to maintain
- Better caching with Next.js
- No need for complex queries
- Faster to implement

### CSS Architecture
**Choice: Utility-first (Tailwind)**
- Matches component architecture
- No naming conventions needed
- Smaller bundle size
- Faster development

## Cost Analysis

### Monthly Costs:
- **Vercel**: $20 (Pro plan)
- **PostgreSQL**: $25 (Railway/Neon)
- **Domain**: $15/year
- **Total**: ~$45/month

### Alternative Stack Costs:
- **AWS Full Stack**: $100-200/month
- **Firebase + Vercel**: $50-100/month
- **Heroku + Services**: $75-150/month

## Risk Mitigation

### What if Next.js doesn't work out?
- React code is portable to any React framework
- API routes can become Express server
- Prisma works with any Node backend

### What if we need mobile apps?
- Next.js API becomes the backend
- React Native can share components
- Progressive Web App as interim solution

### What if traffic explodes?
- Vercel auto-scales
- PostgreSQL can be upgraded
- CDN for static assets
- Redis for caching (later)

## Conclusion

This stack optimizes for:
1. **Developer velocity**: Familiar tools, good DX
2. **Type safety**: End-to-end TypeScript
3. **Performance**: SSR, optimized builds
4. **Scalability**: Can grow with the business
5. **Cost**: Minimal monthly overhead
6. **Flexibility**: Not locked into any single vendor

It's the boring, proven choice - which is exactly what you want for a business-critical platform.
